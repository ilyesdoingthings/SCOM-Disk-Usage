## Microsoft SCOM Server - Disk Usage and Report 

This article provides a PowerShell script that gathers disk usage and then sends the report. I also describe the steps to configure a diagnostic task on a "disk full" alert in SCOM.

## introduction : 

It may happen because we sized a disk wrongly, did not expect growth of the WinSxS folder, neglected to stop IIS logging during troubleshooting, or because the developer did not implement a log-cleanup routine in her application. Full disks can have many reasons.

The first step when receiving an alert about a filling disk is to RDP into a server and use tools to analyze the disk consumption. This takes time and reoccursâ€”an ideal candidate for scripting and automation.

Diagnostic tasks in SCOM can run scripts or commands directly on the affected machine when an alert occurs.
